Use this\\n  for making Python 2.7 code more compatible with Python 3. (This is triggered\\n  if ``W690`` is enabled.)\\n- Normalize files with mixed line endings.\\n- Put a blank line between a class docstring and its first method\\n  declaration. (Enabled with ``E301``.)\\n- Remove blank lines between a function declaration and its docstring. (Enabled\\n  with ``E303``.)\\n\\nautopep8 avoids fixing some issues found by pycodestyle_.\\n\\n- ``E112``/``E113`` for non comments are reports of bad indentation that break\\n  syntax rules. These should not be modified at all.\\n- ``E265``, which refers to spacing after comment hash, is ignored if the\\n  comment looks like code. autopep8 avoids modifying these since they are not\\n  real comments. If you really want to get rid of the pycodestyle_ warning,\\n  consider just removing the commented-out code. (This can be automated via\\n  eradicate_.)\\n\\n.. _eradicate: https://github.com/myint/eradicate\\n\\n\\nMore advanced usage\\n===================\\n\\nBy default autopep8 only makes whitespace changes. Thus, by default, it does\\nnot fix ``E711`` and ``E712``. (Changing ``x == None`` to ``x is None`` may\\nchange the meaning of the program if ``x`` has its ``__eq__`` method\\noverridden.) Nor does it correct deprecated code ``W6``. To enable these\\nmore aggressive fixes, use the ``--aggressive`` option::\\n\\n    $ autopep8 --aggressive <filename>\\n\\nUse multiple ``--aggressive`` to increase the aggressiveness level. For\\nexample, ``E712`` requires aggressiveness level 2 (since ``x == True`` could be\\nchanged to either ``x`` or ``x is True``, but autopep8 chooses the former).\\n\\n``--aggressive`` will also shorten lines more aggressively. It will also remove\\ntrailing whitespace more aggressively. (Usually, we don\'t touch trailing\\nwhitespace in docstrings and other multiline strings. And to do even more\\naggressive changes to docstrings, use docformatter_.)\\n\\n.. _docformatter: https://github.com/myint/docformatter\\n\\nTo enable only a subset of the fixes, use the ``--select`` option. For example,\\nto fix various types of indentation issues::\\n\\n    $ autopep8 --select=E1,W1 <filename>\\n\\nSimilarly, to just fix deprecated code::\\n\\n    $ autopep8 --aggressive --select=W6 <filename>\\n\\nThe above is useful when trying to port a single code base to work with both\\nPython 2 and Python 3 at the same time.\\n\\nIf the file being fixed is large, you may want to enable verbose progress\\nmessages::\\n\\n    $ autopep8 -v <filename>\\n\\nPassing in ``--experimental`` enables the following functionality:\\n\\n- Shortens code lines by taking its length into account\\n\\n::\\n\\n$ autopep8 --experimental <filename>\\n\\nUse as a module\\n===============\\n\\nThe simplest way of using autopep8 as a module is via the ``fix_code()``\\nfunction:\\n\\n    >>> import autopep8\\n    >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'x=       123\\\\n\')\\n    \'x = 123\\\\n\'\\n\\nOr with options:\\n\\n    >>> import autopep8\\n    >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'x.has_key(y)\\\\n\',\\n    ...                   options={\'aggressive\': 1})\\n    \'y in x\\\\n\'\\n    >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'print( 123 )\\\\n\',\\n    ...                   options={\'ignore\': [\'E\']})\\n    \'print( 123 )\\\\n\'\\n\\n\\nConfiguration\\n=============\\n\\nBy default, if ``$HOME/.config/pycodestyle`` (``~\\\\.pycodestyle`` in Windows\\nenvironment) exists, it will be used as global configuration file.\\nAlternatively, you can specify the global configuration file with the\\n``--global-config`` option.\\n\\nAlso, if ``setup.cfg``, ``tox.ini``, ``.pep8`` and ``.flake8`` files exist\\nin the directory where the target file exists, it will be used as the\\nconfiguration file.\\n\\n``pep8``, ``pycodestyle``, and ``flake8`` can be used as a section.\\n\\nconfiguration file example::\\n\\n    [pycodestyle]\\n    max_line_length = 120\\n    ignore = E501\\n\\npyproject.toml\\n--------------\\n\\nautopep8 can also use ``pyproject.toml``.\\nThe section must be ``[tool.autopep8]``, and ``pyproject.toml`` takes precedence\\nover any other configuration files.\\n\\nconfiguration file example::\\n\\n    [tool.autopep8]\\n    max_line_length = 120\\n    ignore = \\"E501,W6\\"  # or [\\"E501\\", \\"W6\\"]\\n    in-place = true\\n    recursive = true\\n    aggressive = 3\\n\\n\\nTesting\\n=======\\n\\nTest cases are in ``test/test_autopep8.py``. They can be run directly via\\n``python test/test_autopep8.py`` or via tox_. The latter is useful for\\ntesting against multiple Python interpreters. (We currently test against\\nCPython versions 2.7, 3.6 3.7 and 3.8. We also test against PyPy.)\\n\\n.. _`tox`: https://pypi.org/project/tox/\\n\\nBroad spectrum testing is available via ``test/acid.py``. This script runs\\nautopep8 against Python code and checks for correctness and completeness of the\\ncode fixes. It can check that the bytecode remains identical.\\n``test/acid_pypi.py`` makes use of ``acid.py`` to test against the latest\\nreleased packages on PyPI.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n===============\\n\\n``pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound``\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you are using an ancient version of ``setuptools``, you might encounter\\n``pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound`` when trying to run ``autopep8``. Try\\nupgrading ``setuptools`` to workaround this ``setuptools`` problem::\\n\\n    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools\\n\\nUse ``sudo`` if you are installing to the system.\\n\\n\\nLinks\\n=====\\n\\n* PyPI_\\n* GitHub_\\n* `Travis CI`_\\n* Coveralls_\\n\\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/\\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8\\n.. _`Travis CI`: https://travis-ci.org/hhatto/autopep8\\n.. _`Coveralls`: https://coveralls.io/r/hhatto/autopep8\\n\\n\\n","description_content_type":null,"download_url":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8","keywords":"automation,pep8,format,pycodestyle","license":"Expat License","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"metadata_version":"2.1","name":"autopep8","obsolete_dist":[],"platform":["UNKNOWN"],"project_url":[],"provides_dist":[],"provides_extra":[],"requires_dist":["pycodestyle (>=2.7.0)","toml"],"requires_external":[],"requires_python":null,"summary":"A tool that automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide","supported_platform":[],"version":"1.5.7"},"beautifulsoup44.6.3":{"author":"Leonard Richardson","author_email":"leonardr@segfault.org","classifier":["Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable","Intended Audience :: Developers","License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License","Programming Language :: Python","Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Topic :: Text Processing :: Markup :: HTML","Topic :: Text Processing :: Markup :: XML","Topic :: Text Processing :: Markup :: SGML","Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules"],"description":null,"description_content_type":"text/markdown","download_url":"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/","home_page":"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/","keywords":null,"license":"MIT","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"metadata_version":"2.1","name":"beautifulsoup4","obsolete_dist":[],"platform":["UNKNOWN"],"project_url":[],"provides_dist":[],"provides_extra":["lxml","html5lib"],"requires_dist":["html5lib;

It provides access\\nto low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version\\n[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)\\nof the WebSocket procotol. This client does not currently support the\\npermessage-deflate extension from\\n[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThis project\'s documentation can be found at\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/)\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can use either `python3 setup.py install` or `pip3 install websocket-client`\\nto install. This module is tested on Python 3.6+.\\n\\n## Usage Tips\\n\\nCheck out the documentation\'s FAQ for additional guidelines:\\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\\n\\nKnown issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression\\nsupport (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nThe `send` and `validate_utf8` methods can sometimes be bottleneck.\\nYou can disable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a\\nperformance enhancement) with the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter.\\nIf you want to get better performance, install wsaccel. While\\nwebsocket-client does not depend on wsaccel, it will be used if\\navailable. wsaccel doubles the speed of UTF8 validation and\\noffers a very minor 10% performance boost when masking the\\npayload data as part of the `send` process. Numpy used to\\nbe a suggested performance enhancement alternative, but\\n[issue #687](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues/687)\\nfound it didn\'t help.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nMany more examples are found in the\\n[examples documentation](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).\\n\\n### Long-lived Connection\\n\\nMost real-world WebSockets situations involve longer-lived connections.\\nThe WebSocketApp `run_forever` loop automatically tries to reconnect when a\\nconnection is lost, and provides a variety of event-based connection controls.\\n\\n```python\\nimport websocket\\ntry:\\n    import thread\\nexcept ImportError:\\n    import _thread as thread\\nimport time\\n\\ndef on_message(ws, message):\\n    print(message)\\n\\ndef on_error(ws, error):\\n    print(error)\\n\\ndef on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):\\n    print(\\"### closed ###\\")\\n\\ndef on_open(ws):\\n    def run(*args):\\n        for i in range(3):\\n            time.sleep(1)\\n            ws.send(\\"Hello %d\\" % i)\\n        time.sleep(1)\\n        ws.close()\\n        print(\\"thread terminating...\\")\\n    thread.start_new_thread(run, ())\\n\\nif __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\\n    websocket.enableTrace(True)\\n    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\\",\\n                              on_open=on_open,\\n                              on_message=on_message,\\n                              on_error=on_error,\\n                              on_close=on_close)\\n\\n    ws.run_forever()\\n```\\n\\n### Short-lived Connection\\n\\nThis is if you want to communicate a short message and disconnect\\nimmediately when done. For example, if you want to confirm that a WebSocket\\nserver is running and responds properly to a specific request.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom websocket import create_connection\\nws = create_connection(\\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\\")\\nprint(\\"Sending \'Hello, World\'...\\")\\nws.send(\\"Hello, World\\")\\nprint(\\"Sent\\")\\nprint(\\"Receiving...\\")\\nresult =  ws.recv()\\nprint(\\"Received \'%s\'\\" % result)\\nws.close()\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to customize socket options, set sockopt, as seen below:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom websocket import create_connection\\nws = create_connection(\\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\\",\\n                        sockopt=((socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY),))\\n```\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\n\\nThanks to @battlemidget and @ralphbean for helping migrate this project to\\nPython 3.\\n\\n\\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","download_url":"https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/releases","home_page":"https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client.git","keywords":"websockets client","license":"LGPL version 2.1","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"metadata_version":"2.1","name":"websocket-client","obsolete_dist":[],"platform":["UNKNOWN"],"project_url":["Documentation, https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/","Source, https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/"],"provides_dist":[],"provides_extra":[],"requires_dist":[],"requires_external":[],"requires_python":">=3.6","summary":"WebSocket client for Python with low level API options","supported_platform":[],"version":"1.1.0"},"werkzeug2.0.1":{"author":"Armin Ronacher","author_email":"armin.ronacher@active-4.com","classifier":["Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable","Environment :: Web Environment","Intended Audience :: Developers","License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License","Operating System :: OS Independent","Programming Language :: Python","Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content","Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: WSGI","Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: WSGI :: Application","Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: WSGI :: Middleware","Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks"],"description":null,"description_content_type":"text/x-rst","download_url":null,"home_page":"https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/","keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","maintainer":"Pallets","maintainer_email":"contact@palletsprojects.com","metadata_version":"2.1","name":"Werkzeug","obsolete_dist":[],"platform":["UNKNOWN"],"project_url":["Donate, https://palletsprojects.com/donate","Documentation, https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/","Changes, https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/changes/","Source Code, https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/","Issue Tracker, https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/","Twitter, https://twitter.com/PalletsTeam","Chat, https://discord.gg/pallets"],"provides_dist":[],"provides_extra":["watchdog"],"requires_dist":["dataclasses ;

These should not be modified at all.\\n        - ``E265``, which refers to spacing after comment hash, is ignored if the\\n          comment looks like code. autopep8 avoids modifying these since they are not\\n          real comments. If you really want to get rid of the pycodestyle_ warning,\\n          consider just removing the commented-out code. (This can be automated via\\n          eradicate_.)\\n        \\n        .. _eradicate: https://github.com/myint/eradicate\\n        \\n        \\n        More advanced usage\\n        ===================\\n        \\n        By default autopep8 only makes whitespace changes. Thus, by default, it does\\n        not fix ``E711`` and ``E712``. (Changing ``x == None`` to ``x is None`` may\\n        change the meaning of the program if ``x`` has its ``__eq__`` method\\n        overridden.) Nor does it correct deprecated code ``W6``. To enable these\\n        more aggressive fixes, use the ``--aggressive`` option::\\n        \\n            $ autopep8 --aggressive <filename>\\n        \\n        Use multiple ``--aggressive`` to increase the aggressiveness level. For\\n        example, ``E712`` requires aggressiveness level 2 (since ``x == True`` could be\\n        changed to either ``x`` or ``x is True``, but autopep8 chooses the former).\\n        \\n        ``--aggressive`` will also shorten lines more aggressively. It will also remove\\n        trailing whitespace more aggressively. (Usually, we don\'t touch trailing\\n        whitespace in docstrings and other multiline strings. And to do even more\\n        aggressive changes to docstrings, use docformatter_.)\\n        \\n        .. _docformatter: https://github.com/myint/docformatter\\n        \\n        To enable only a subset of the fixes, use the ``--select`` option. For example,\\n        to fix various types of indentation issues::\\n        \\n            $ autopep8 --select=E1,W1 <filename>\\n        \\n        Similarly, to just fix deprecated code::\\n        \\n            $ autopep8 --aggressive --select=W6 <filename>\\n        \\n        The above is useful when trying to port a single code base to work with both\\n        Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time.\\n        \\n        If the file being fixed is large, you may want to enable verbose progress\\n        messages::\\n        \\n            $ autopep8 -v <filename>\\n        \\n        \\n        Use as a module\\n        ===============\\n        \\n        The simplest way of using autopep8 as a module is via the ``fix_code()``\\n        function:\\n        \\n            >>> import autopep8\\n            >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'x=       123\\\\n\')\\n            \'x = 123\\\\n\'\\n        \\n        Or with options:\\n        \\n            >>> import autopep8\\n            >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'x.has_key(y)\\\\n\',\\n            ...                   options={\'aggressive\': 1})\\n            \'y in x\\\\n\'\\n            >>> autopep8.fix_code(\'print( 123 )\\\\n\',\\n            ...                   options={\'ignore\': [\'E\']})\\n            \'print( 123 )\\\\n\'\\n        \\n        \\n        Testing\\n        =======\\n        \\n        Test cases are in ``test/test_autopep8.py``. They can be run directly via\\n        ``python test/test_autopep8.py`` or via tox_. The latter is useful for\\n        testing against multiple Python interpreters. (We currently test against\\n        CPython versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

There are several\\nprominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or\\nboth of the following:\\n\\n1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.\\n2. They predate the `OAuth 2.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 6749.\\n3. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.\\n\\n.. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849\\n.. _`OAuth 2.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749\\n\\nOAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without\\nassuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth\\nclient support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your\\nfavourite web framework. If you\'re a maintainer of such a library, write a thin\\nveneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n--------------\\n\\nFull documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_.
